MAHDIUR RAHMAN
Assignment 4
Graph, Dijsktra and Priority Queue

I. Which parts were completed?
Every part was completed.

II. Any bugs?
No bugs. The biggest issue was more about how confusing Dijsktra's method got when using pointers.
But I made it through.
This was a very rewarding assignment. I like that it forced me to use 3 seperate data structures.

III. Instructions

1. Unzip folder Mahdiur_Rahman_Assignment4.zip
2. Open unzipped file.
3. Open linux terminal
4. navigate to Mahdiur_Rahman_Assignment4

6. Part 2: Dijsktra's Algorithm
    A. in the terminal type:
